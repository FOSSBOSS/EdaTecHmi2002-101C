Notes:
install script 12.30.24: Whats working:
A clean install of bookworm, with the reccomended softwares, runs fine, including HDMI co-output.

Whats less functional:
the light version, of any bookworm version of Raspbian even after installing known dependencies.
This probably means my dependencies have dependencies or something like that.


What is not functional:
upgraded versions of Raspbian might have issues. Not so much as a driver issue, but as writing the right values to the right config files.


Other dysfunctional obsurvations:
removal of the touchscreen, after installation, even if the HMDI is working, seems to break both video output modes.
